        <SectionTitle>Our Story</SectionTitle>
        <SectionText>
          Curious Thing started in July 2018 after our three founders asked each
          other, “What if we can make an AI curious?”
          <br />
          <br />
          Seeing the limitations of today&apos;s intent-matching AI framework,
          they sought to build an AI that is designed to ask open-content
          questions and derive insights from people.
          <br />
          <br />
          Today, our platform allows businesses to redefine how they communicate
          with their customers through proactive engagement. We have processed
          over 3 million minutes of AI-human conversations and have grown the
          core team to over 30 members.
